# customer-churn-prediction
This project focuses on predicting customer churn — the likelihood of customers discontinuing a service — using machine learning techniques in Python. By leveraging historical customer data, the model helps businesses identify potential churners and take proactive measures to improve customer retention.

#Objectives:
Analyze customer behavior patterns.

Predict churn using supervised machine learning algorithms.

Provide insights into key factors influencing churn.

#Tools & Technologies:
Programming Language: Python

Libraries Used:

pandas, numpy – for data manipulation and analysis

matplotlib, seaborn – for data visualization

scikit-learn – for preprocessing, model building, and evaluation

xgboost – for gradient boosting implementation

joblib or pickle – for model serialization (optional)

Algorithms Implemented:
Logistic Regression – for baseline binary classification

Random Forest Classifier – for robust ensemble learning using decision trees

Gradient Boosting Classifier – for high-performance prediction through boosting

Key Project Steps:
Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values

Encoding categorical variables (Label Encoding / One-Hot Encoding)

Feature scaling using StandardScaler

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizing churn distribution

Identifying correlations and trends

Model Building & Evaluation:

Splitting data into training and testing sets

Training models using the three algorithms

Evaluating performance using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC

Feature Importance Analysis:

Interpreting key features contributing to customer churn

(Optional) Model Deployment:

Exporting the model for integration into a web or business application

Outcome:
The final models help predict customer churn with high accuracy, enabling strategic business decisions to retain valuable customers and reduce attrition.
